Experimental Study on Scalable Post-Groomer of Wildfire HTAP System on Cloud
======

Wildfire is a Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) system developed at IBM Research â€“ Almaden. In Wildfire, transactions first append writes into a transaction log, which is then groomed into columnar data blocks. The groomed data is further periodically post-groomed to a more analytics-friendly organization. In the essay, I will focus on the performance and scalability aspect of the post-groomer in Wildfire through experimentation on IBM Research Cloud. I will also experiment and compare with different indexing techniques on the post-groomed data.
